## USAGE
At the moment, only the _Elemental Mapping_ function is fully operational.
This code requires, *Python 3.x*, *numpy*, *matplotlib* and *PyMca* modules installed.
To install any of them, simply type at your prompt screen:
`pip install module`, where module is the module name.

To run the code, firstly place all data files under `C:\misure` folder and enter the configuration parameters onto config.cfg file.
This step is not yet optimized and still requires a great deal of user interaction. Folder name and config information will be automated in the near future.
At least, type in your prompt window (cmd on Windows) `python -Mapping.py -help` to get the usage options.
_*Mapping.py*_ can provide elemental mapping of any single chemical element, density map and stack plot of all spectrum.
To save any of the produced images, simply click on the save icon, in the lower right corner of the plot window.
